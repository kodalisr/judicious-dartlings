"18. Wrap the dough lightly over the rolling pin, and set it in the un-greased pie plate. Press it into place, and crimp the outside edges with your finger or a fork.",
"19. Spread the apples evenly onto the crust; pour the filling over the apples and then sprinkle the topping evenly over the top.",
"20. Bake for 50 to 60 minutes, until the filling is bubbling and the topping is brown.",
